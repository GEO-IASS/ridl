rIDL 1.0
--------

  * .edit executive command uses RIDL_EDITOR and EDITOR environment variables
    to launch an editor.
    
  * filename completion
  
  * :doc magic command displays header information about a routine.
  
  * :log/:unlog magic command. To get a log of the session, both commands and
    output, use::
    
       rIDL> :log filename

  * Use the :help magic command to get information about all the currently
    available magic commands.

  * Readline history commands are available with :!. For example, to replace a 
    string::
    
       rIDL> a = '/path/to/datafile'
       rIDL> :!!:s/a/b/
       rIDL> b = '/path/to/datafile'
  
    Here, the first two lines are typed and the third line is created by the 
    second line. Search for help on using Readline history for more   
    information about commands available (just put them after a :).    
      
  * Command line switches -v to print the rIDL/IDL versions and -h to print
    help on the available command line options.
    
  
IDL functionality not in rIDL
-----------------------------

  * widget support
  
  * not all command line switches
  
  * does not change IDL's command history file (not sure how this should work, 
    should there be two separate history files? just use IDL's? just use
    rIDL's?)
