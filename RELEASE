rIDL 0.1
--------

  * .edit executive command uses RIDL_EDITOR and EDITOR environment variables
    to launch an editor.
    
  * filename completion
  
  * :doc magic command displays header information about a routine.
  
  * :log/:unlog magic command. To get a log of the session, both commands and
    output, use::
    
       rIDL> :log filename

  * Use the :help magic command to get information about all the currently
    available magic commands.

  * Keybindings are supported. Currently F5, F6, and F7 are step into, step 
    over, and step return.
  
  * Readline history commands are available with :!. For example, to replace a 
    string::
    
       rIDL> a = '/path/to/datafile'
       rIDL> :!!:s/a/b/
       rIDL> b = '/path/to/datafile'
  
    Here, the first two lines are typed and the third line is created by the 
    second line. Search for help on using Readline history for more   
    information about commands available (just put them after a :).    
      
  * Command line switches -v to print the rIDL/IDL versions and -h to print
    help on the available command line options.
    
  * Commands are saved in the history file as they are entered so that an IDL 
    crash does not lose all the history from that session.
  
  
IDL functionality not in rIDL
-----------------------------
  
  * setting preferences via a command line switch when starting is not 
    supported
