rIDL 1.0
--------

  * .edit executive command uses RIDL_EDITOR and EDITOR environment variables
    to launch an editor.
    
  * filename completion
  
  * :doc magic command displays header information about a routine.
  
  * :log/:unlog magic command. To get a log of the session, both commands and
    output, use::
    
       rIDL> :log filename

  * Readline history commands are available with :!. For example, to replace a 
    string::
    
       rIDL> a = '/path/to/datafile'
       rIDL> :!!:s/a/b/
       rIDL> b = '/path/to/datafile'
  
    Here, the first two lines are typed and the third line is created by the 
    second line. Search for help on using Readline history for more   
    information about commands available (just put them after a :).
