============

Make sure to point LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for Macs) to the appropriate bin directory of the IDL distribution i.e.::
 
  /usr/local/itt/idl/bin/bin.bin.linux.x86_64 
  
for 64-bit Linux or::

  /Applications/itt/idl/bin/bin.darwin.x86_64 
  
for 64-bit Mac.

The GNU Readline library is required to be installed in the standard location i.e. /usr/local.
