Installation
============

The GNU Readline library is required to be installed in the standard location i.e. /usr/local.

Currently, the system only works on Mac OS X, but should easily work on other UNIX systems with a few changes to the Makefiles.

Set the RIDL_EDITOR or the EDITOR environment variable to specify the editor to use with the .edit command. For example, under the Bash shell this would be::

  export RIDL_EDITOR="emacs -nw"
  
The src/ directory of the distribution should in your IDL_PATH.

Also, set the RIDL_DIR environment variable to the top-level directory of the rIDL distribution.
