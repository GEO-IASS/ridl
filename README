Building
========

The GNU Readline library is required to be installed before building rIDL.

rIDL uses CMake for its build system. In many cases, the only thing required
is::

  $ cmake .
  $ make
  $ make install

If you want to install somewhere besides the default location, then the
``cmake`` command would like::

  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install .

CMake allows the locations of the libraries it needs to be specified also. For
example, to specify a special location for Readline::

  cmake -DReadline_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/readline/6.1/include \
        -DReadline_LIBRARY=/usr/local/readline/6.1/lib/libreadline.dylib \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install \
        .


Installation
============

After rIDL is built, a few environment variables need to be set for rIDL to
work correctly.

The share/idl/ directory of the installation should in your IDL_PATH.

Also, set the RIDL_DIR environment variable to the top-level directory of the
rIDL installation.

Set the RIDL_EDITOR or the EDITOR environment variable to specify the editor
to use with the ``.edit command``. For example, under the Bash shell this
would be::

  export RIDL_EDITOR="emacs -nw"
