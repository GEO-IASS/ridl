These are the features that I believe rIDL should have before it reaches version 1.0:

#. everything in regular IDL command line should work in rIDL

#. tab completion of: 

   #. structure/object fields fields
   #. variable names
   #. routine/method names
   #. routine params/keywords
   #. filenames in executive command or strings

#. .edit should work

#. copy and paste multiple lines

#. history magic command

#. enhanced journal magic command

#. magic command to send commands from current session to file

#. multiple IDL_IDLBridge like Abraham's command line

#. should except all IDL command line options plus --help and --version

#. handle long command lines with some kinds of grace, i.e., able to combine a several commands ending with $'s into one long command
