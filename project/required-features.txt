These are the features that I believe rIDL should have before it reaches version 1.0:

#. everything in regular IDL command line should work in rIDL

#. tab completion of: 

   #. structure/object fields fields (done)
   #. local variable names (done)
   #. routine/method names
   #. routine keyword names
   #. filenames in executive command or strings (done)
   #. system variables (done)
   #. executive commands

#. .edit should work (done)

#. copy and paste multiple lines (done)

#. history magic command (done)

#. enhanced journal magic command (done)

#. magic command to send commands from current session to file (done)

#. multiple IDL_IDLBridge like Abraham's command line

#. should except all IDL command line options plus --help and --version

#. handle long command lines with some kinds of grace, i.e., able to combine a several commands ending with $'s into one long command (done)
