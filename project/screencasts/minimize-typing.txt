One of the most useful features of rIDL is tab completion. rIDL can complete system variables, IDL library names, currently compile routine names, filenames, fields of a structure, executive commands, and magic commands.

For example, there is a field of the `!version` system variable that specifies the type of operating system. Typing ``!`` and hitting tab twice shows all the system variables::

  IDL> print, !
  !c            !dpi          !except       !more         !pi           !version      
  !cpu          !dtor         !help_path    !mouse        !prompt       !warn         
  !d            !edit_input   !journal      !order        !quiet        !x            
  !dir          !err          !make_dll     !p            !radeg        !y            
  !dlm_path     !error_state  !map          !path         !values       !z

Typing "ve" makes "version" unique::
  IDL> print, !ve
  
So hitting tab again fills in "version". Adding the dot and hitting tab twice gives me the possible field names::

  IDL> print, !version.
  !version.arch              !version.memory_bits       !version.os_name
  !version.build_date        !version.os                !version.release
  !version.file_offset_bits  !version.os_family 

Typing "o" gives me the "s", typing "_f" gives me the full field name::

  IDL> print, !version.o
  IDL> print, !version.os
  IDL> print, !version.os
  !version.os         !version.os_family  !version.os_name
  IDL> print, !version.os_f
  IDL> print, !version.os_family
  unix

Completion makes typing long filenames much less painful. For example, when specifying a path in a string::

  IDL> loc = '~/projects/idllib/trunk/src'
  
Or a file to compile or execute::

  IDL> .run ~/projects/idllib/trunk/src/hdf5/mg_h5.pro
  
rIDL can also bind keystrokes to commonly executed commands like the step executive command useful when debugging or the save_graphic magic command for saving the current graphics window.

To see a list of the current keybindings, use the help magic command::

  IDL> :help

Those escape codes represent F5, F6, F7, and control-g. For example, hitting control-g attempts to save a graphic (which of course is not valid now since I am not recording a notebook).
