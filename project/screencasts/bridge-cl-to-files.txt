Hello, I would like to show you a few features I have recently added to rIDL, an enhanced command line for IDL.

I frequently find myself entering a sequence of a few commands at the command line so that I can verify intermediate results. After getting the sequence working, I then would like to save those commands to a file. IDL has a JOURNAL command and rIDL adds the log and tee magic commands, but these commands require that you begin the logging before you start entering the commands, which I'm never aware enough to do. I will demonstrate some new rIDL features to retroactively save commands using rIDL's command history.

First, I need to type in a few lines. My simple example will load an image from a file and display it::
  
  IDL> filename = filepath('people.jpg', $
  .... subdir=['examples', 'data'])
  
Note that rIDL combines these two lines into a single line in the history. ::

  IDL> print, filename
  IDL> people = read_image(filename)
  IDL> dimensions = size(people, /dimensions)
  IDL> window, /free, xsize=dimensions[1], ysize=dimensions[2]
  IDL> tv, people, true=1

Now that we have it working at the command line, rIDL has a couple ways to repeat a sequence of commands. First, the history magic command can be used to display the last commands::

  IDL> :history

This defaults to the last 10 commands, but a particular number can be asked for::

  IDL> :history 20

By default, history numbers the commands to show where they are in your command history, but more convenient for saving is the "nonum" option::

  IDL> :history nonum

Now, the lines can be copy-and-pasted easily back to the command line or to a file. Even more convenient is the histedit magic command which sends a particular number of commands to a file::

   IDL> :histedit 6 mg_readpeople.pro

The file can be viewed and edited again with `.edit`::

  IDL> .edit mg_readpeople

One of the goals of rIDL is to bridge the gap between working from the command line and writing routines in files and I hope these new features can help achieve that.

Thanks for listening.
