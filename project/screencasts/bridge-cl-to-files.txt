One of the goals of rIDL is to bridge the gap between working from the command line and writing routines in files.

For example, it is common to try some code at the command line so that progress can be checked after each line is entered. For example, ...



Now that we have it working on the command line, rIDL has a couple ways to repeat several commands. First, the history magic command can be used to display the last commands:

  IDL> :history 10

But, more appropriately for cutting-and-pasting, use the qhistory magic command:

  IDL> :qhistory 10

(cut-and-paste back to command line)

This cut-and-paste technique can be used to paste the code into a file as well, but there is an even better way to do that using the histedit magic command:

  IDL> :histedit 10 mg_...
